&lt;p>‘Fake news’ and broader ‘information disorders’ [6] such as mis- and disinformation have emerged as global issues that threaten to undermine democracy and authentic political communication on social media [1]. Increasingly sophisticated coordination strategies have intensified the scale and scope of the impact that disinformation has on public opinion and democratic trust. Howard et al. [3] found that coordinated disinformation operations are now occurring in 48 countries, and in 2019 the European External Action Service detected and exposed over 1,000 cases of disinformation within the European Union [2]. Whilst disinformation has attracted much scholarly attention, most studies to date have focussed on the diffusion and impact of individual content (e.g. ‘fake news’ articles) and the activity of individual accounts (e.g. bots and trolls).
An emerging problem is to understand message coordination strategies, where content authored and distributed by agents (e.g. Twitter trolls) is governed and scheduled by some unknown principal actor [4]. We know that coordinated promotion (e.g. sharing, liking, retweeting) of ‘fake news’ articles by trolls and social bots can greatly increase and amplify the negative effects of these attempts to sow discord and manipulate public conversations about election candidates and partisan issues such as immigration and climate change. Likewise, it is evident that disinformation campaigns unfold via ‘collaborative work’ that co-opts and cultivates organic systems in order to produce desired effects such as increased polarisation, distrust in news media and confusion of the audience [7]. This makes identifying ‘inauthentic’ versus ‘organic’ activity ever more difficult, as they are intricately enmeshed in real-world disinformation campaigns.
In this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring the coordinated promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ articles using a novel approach known as Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP; see [5]). We analyse the diffusion of articles from ten major sources of hyperpartisan information and ‘fake news’ within over 16.5 million tweets that linked to content from these sites during July to September 2019. Using HIP, we uncover not only coordination strategies but also the promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ content, where agents (in this case Twitter accounts) are being centrally managed by principals (e.g. state operatives, government officials, etc.) in order to strategically promote ‘fake news’ content and maximise its virality and longevity in the social memory. This paper provides preliminary results from this ongoing research, highlighting the current challenges as well as open problems and gaps for future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="panel-rationale">Panel Rationale&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Social media platforms are increasingly forced to address what Facebook now describes as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (Gleicher 2018): online influence operations that seek to trick platform algorithms into promoting and recommending ‘problematic information’ (Jack 2017), to mislead the human users of such platforms into accepting and sharing such content, and thereby also to affect broader issue frames and news agendas in mainstream media coverage. Concerns about such coordinated inauthentic behaviour extend earlier fears about the influence of malignant social bots, but also transcend them: drawing on social bots as well as human labour, coordinated inauthentic behaviour is likely to involve a combination of manual and automated activity. This additional human factor also complicates the detection of such coordinated activities, and their distinction from genuine, organic, authentic coordinated actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cross-national and interdisciplinary panel approaches the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour from a number of directions. It outlines novel and innovative detection and analysis approaches for a number of leading social media platforms, and presents their results in the context of domestic and international political debates across several national contexts. Further, it also considers how mainstream journalism might report on and respond to such activities in order to protect news audiences from being affected by coordinated inauthentic behaviours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two papers in this panel focus especially on coordinated inauthentic link-sharing practices. Paper 1 introduces Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP), a novel technique for inferring the coordinated content promotion schedules of automated social media accounts, and applies this to a major dataset of 16.5 million tweets containing links to ten major sites identified as sources of hyperpartisan content and ‘fake news’. In doing so, it uncovers new networks of inauthentic Twitter actors. Paper 2 investigates similar coordinated link-sharing activity on Facebook in Italy during the 2018 Italian and 2019 European elections. It uncovers evidence for the involvement of dozens of pages, groups, and public profiles in such media manipulation attempts. Paper 3 complements this work by focussing especially on the temporal posting patterns in such coordinated activity. It employs the recurrence plotting technique to identify traces of inauthentic actors’ use of automated scheduling tools in systematically posting content to a network of apparently unrelated pages, focussing here especially on a group of far-right pages on Facebook. Paper 4 examines ten coordinated disinformation campaigns across the globe (e.g., Hong Kong, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany) and identifies important traits that help distinguish between those participating in the disinformation campaign and the regular users they try to imitate. Paper 5, finally, shifts our attention to a core target of such coordinated inauthentic behaviour: the journalists and editors whose perception of current political moods such influence operations often aim to affect. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with Danish news workers and related stakeholders, it examines their understanding of and responses to coordinated mis- and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collectively, these studies contribute substantially to advancing the methodological toolkit and extending the empirical evidence base for the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, while also not losing sight of the stakeholders that such work seeks to support. They offer an independent assessment of the nature and extent of the problem across several leading social media platforms, complementing the platform providers’ own investigations into such activities and identifying possible responses to such concerns for both social and mainstream media actors.&lt;/p>

Last year, the number of websites registered on the &amp;ldquo;.com&amp;rdquo; domain &lt;a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/zone-file/index.xhtml">surpassed 150,000,000&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, more than a quarter of a century since its first commercial use, the growth of the online world is now slowing down in some key categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conducted a multi-year research project analysing global trends in online diversity and dominance. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249993">Our research&lt;/a>, published in Public Library of Science, is the first to reveal some long-term trends in how businesses compete in the age of the web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We saw a dramatic consolidation of attention towards a shrinking (but increasingly dominant) group of online organisations. So, while there is still growth in the functions, features and applications offered on the web, the number of entities providing these functions is shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-diversity-nosedives">Web diversity nosedives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We analysed more than six billion user comments from the social media website Reddit dating back to 2006, as well as 11.8 billion Twitter posts from as far back as 2011. In total, our research used a massive 5.6Tb trove of data from more than a decade of global activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This dataset was more than four times the size of the original data from the Hubble Space Telescope, which helped Brian Schmidt and colleagues do their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-win-tells-us-the-universe-is-accelerating-what-does-that-mean-3753">Nobel-prize winning work&lt;/a> in 1998 to prove &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300499/meta">the universe's expansion is accelerating&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Reddit posts, we analysed all the links to other sites and online services — more than one billion in total — to understand the dynamics of link growth, dominance and diversity through the decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We used a measure of link &amp;ldquo;uniqueness&amp;rdquo;. On this scale, 1 represents maximum diversity (all links have their own domain) and 0 is minimum diversity (all links are on one domain, such as &amp;ldquo;youtube.com&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decade ago, there was a much greater variety of domains within links posted by users of Reddit, with more than 20 different domains for every 100 random links users posted. Now there are only about five different domains for every 100 links posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig1.png" alt="Our Reddit analysis showed the pool of top-performing sources online is shrinking.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, between 60-70% of all attention on key social media platforms is focused towards just ten popular domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond social media platforms, we also studied linkage patterns across the web, looking at almost 20 billion links over three years. These results reinforced the &amp;ldquo;rich are getting richer&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authority, influence and visibility of the top 1,000 global websites (as measured by network centrality or PageRank) is growing every month, at the expense of all other sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="app-diversity-is-on-the-rise">App diversity is on the rise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The web started as a source of innovation, new ideas and inspiration — a technology that opened up the playing field. It's now also becoming a medium that actually stifles competition and promotes monopolies and the dominance of a few players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings resolve a long-running paradox about the nature of the web: does it help grow businesses, jobs and investment? Or does it make it harder to get ahead by letting anyone and everyone join the game? The answer, it turns out, is it does both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the diversity of sources is in decline, there is a countervailing force of continually increasing functionality with new services, products and applications — such as music streaming services (Spotify), file sharing programs (Dropbox) and messaging platforms (Messenger, Whatsapp and Snapchat).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig2.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="website-infant-mortality">Website ‘infant mortality&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another major finding was the dramatic increase in the &amp;ldquo;infant mortality&amp;rdquo; rate of websites — with the big kids on the block guarding their turf more staunchly than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We examined new domains that were continually referenced or linked-to in social media after their first appearance. We found that while almost 40% of the domains created 2006 were active five years on, only a little more than 3% of those created in 2015 remain active today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dynamics of online competition are becoming clearer and clearer. And the loss of diversity is concerning. Unlike the natural world, there are no sanctuaries; competition is part of both nature and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our study has profound implications for business leaders, investors and governments everywhere. It shows the network effects of the web don't just apply to online businesses. They have permeated the entire economy and are rewriting many previously accepted rules of economics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the idea that businesses can maintain a competitive advantage based on where they are physically located is increasingly tenuous. Meanwhile, there's new opportunities for companies to set up shop from anywhere in the world and serve a global customer base that's both mainstream and niche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig3.png" alt="Functional diversity grows continuously online.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way to encourage diversity is to have more global online businesses focused on providing diverse services, by addressing consumers&amp;rsquo; increasingly niche needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Australia, we're starting to see this through homegrown companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://safetyculture.com/">SafetyCulture&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://iwonder.com/">iWonder&lt;/a>. Hopefully many more will appear in the decade ahead.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We build a machine learning-based &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> that can accurately predict the probability of transitioning between occupations. We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles and real-time job ads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also build a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For full technical details, please read the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our latest research, &lt;a href="authors/nik-dawson/">Nik Dawson&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="authors/ma-rizoiu/">Marian-Andrei Rizoiu&lt;/a> (together with collaborator &lt;a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-mary-anne-williams">Mary-Anne Williams&lt;/a>) and I developed a novel method to measure the &amp;lsquo;distance&amp;rsquo; between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em> using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn't to say that it's not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-skill-space-method">The SKILL SPACE Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between skills&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage&amp;rsquo; (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1A.png" alt="Figure 1A.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python&amp;rsquo; and ‘C++&amp;rsquo;. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development&amp;rsquo; and ‘Healthcare&amp;rsquo;) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge&amp;rsquo; to specialist skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distance between occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between &lt;em>sets of skills&lt;/em>. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig1B.png" alt="Figure 1B.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244">Frey and Osborne&lt;/a> - dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo;, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer&amp;rsquo; represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker&amp;rsquo; that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="constructing-a-job-transitions-recommender-system">Constructing a Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that &lt;strong>job transitions are &lt;em>asymmetric&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual&amp;rsquo; (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset - described as the transition probability between a ‘source&amp;rsquo; and a ‘target&amp;rsquo; occupation. This creates the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em>, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig2.png" alt="Figure 2.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source&amp;rsquo; occupations are in columns and ‘targets&amp;rsquo; are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager&amp;rsquo; has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk&amp;rsquo; than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas&amp;rsquo;) than others (‘Life Scientists&amp;rsquo;). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our model achieves high levels of performance, &lt;strong>accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommending-jobs-and-skills">Recommending Jobs and Skills&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations. We call this the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em>. In the figure below, we highlight the example of `Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo;, an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig4.png" alt="Figure 4.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we use the &lt;em>Transitions Map&lt;/em> to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners&amp;rsquo; all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential&amp;rsquo; services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo;, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favorable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers&amp;rsquo; as the target occupation for this example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Skill recommendations for target occupations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then take the &lt;em>Job Transitions Recommender System&lt;/em> a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is important to the target occupation&lt;/strong> &lt;em>and&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance to acquire the skill is large&lt;/strong> (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance&amp;rsquo;. Conversely, the reasons &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to develop a skill are when (1) the &lt;strong>skill is not important&lt;/strong> &lt;em>or&lt;/em> (2) the &lt;strong>distance is small to the target occupation&lt;/strong>. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs require ‘Business Analysis&amp;rsquo; and ‘Finance&amp;rsquo; skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing&amp;rsquo; and ‘Laundry&amp;rsquo; are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer&amp;rsquo; jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner&amp;rsquo; already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developing-a-leading-indicator-of-ai-adoption">Developing a Leading Indicator of AI Adoption&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SKILL SPACE method can also be flexibly applied to other adjacent problems, such as identifying the extent of specific skill gaps of firms within industries and potential adoption of new technologies. Here, we develop a leading indicator for emerging technology adoption and potential labour market disruptions based on skills data, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example. We select AI because of its potential impacts on transforming labour tasks and accelerating job transitions. By applying SKILL SPACE, we were able to measure the yearly similarities between an adaptive set of AI skills against each of the 19 Australian industries from 2013-2019 (see the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print&lt;/a> for technical details). As industry skill sets become more similar to AI skills, the skills gap is diminished and firms within industries are more likely to possess the skills to make productive use of AI technologies. The growth of AI skill similarity within industries is shown by the coloured areas of the radar chart below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/fig5.png" alt="Figure 5.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All industries have increased their similarity levels to AI skills. This highlights the growing importance of AI skills across the Australian labour market. However, the rates of similarity are unequally distributed. Some industries, such as ‘Finance and Insurance Services&amp;rsquo; and ‘Information Media and Telecommunications&amp;rsquo; command much higher rates of AI skill similarity. This indicates that not only are firms within these industries increasingly demanding AI skills but also that the AI skills gaps within these industries are much smaller. Therefore, it is likely that firms within these industries are adopting AI and making productive use of these technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also noteworthy are the differences in growth rates toward AI skill similarity. As the figure above clearly shows, AI skill similarity has rapidly grown for some industries and more modestly for others. For instance, ‘Retail Trade&amp;rsquo; has experienced the highest levels of growth in similarity to AI skills, increasing by 407% from 2013 to 2019. The majority of this growth has occurred recently, which coincides with the launch of Amazon Australia in 2017. Since then, Amazon has swiftly hired thousands in Australia. This indicator can assist policy-makers and businesses to robustly monitor the growth of AI skills (or other emerging technologies), which acts as a proxy for AI adoption within industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises, and other factors will continue to shift labour demands causing workers to move between jobs. If labour transitions occur efficiently, significant productivity and equity benefits arise at all levels of the labour market; if transitions are slow, or fail, significant costs are borne to both the State and the individual. Therefore, it's in the interests of workers, firms, and governments that labour transitions are efficient and effective. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.&lt;/p>
