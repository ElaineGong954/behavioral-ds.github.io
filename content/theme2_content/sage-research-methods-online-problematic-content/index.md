[Andrei](/authors/ma-rizoiu/) was interviewed by SAGE Research Methods for the [Doing Online Research](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/sage-research-methods-doing-research-online) case study collection.
He discusses a case study using qualitative approaches and machine learning to map online problematic content, including blending digital ethnography and advanced machine learning, data collection, dataset augmentation, results, lessons learned, and recommendations.

There is a strong focus on the interdisciplinarity of the work -- a collaboration with digital communication scientists [Amelia Johns](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Amelia.Johns) and [Francesco Bailo](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Francesco.Bailo), literary scientist [Emily Booth](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Emily.Booth), and computer scientists [Quyu Kong](/authors/quyu-kong/) and [Marian-Andrei Rizoiu](/authors/ma-rizoiu/).

The interview is based on our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00302.pdf) published in [ICWSM 2022](https://www.icwsm.org/2022/index.html/), where we propose a complete solution to accelerate the qualitative analysis of problematic online speech — with a specific focus on opinions emerging from online communities — by leveraging machine learning algorithms.
