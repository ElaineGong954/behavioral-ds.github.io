In this [working paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04097.pdf), we propose a completely automatic end-to-end ideology detection pipeline, for the detection and psychosocial profiling of both left, right, and far-right ideological users. The pipeline fills a crucial gap by providing flexible methodology and tooling for understanding ideologies and alerting against extreme ideology-motivated (and potentially violent) activity.

## Ideology in an Online World

Ideology is the basis of how we make sense of much of the world, the opinions we hold, and the political actions we take. It is not a new concept and is often the context of unrest throughout history. 
However, in an online world, where the internet is a major source of information, and opinions spread quickly through social platforms; ideological spread and radicalization have entered a new paradigm.
In particular, the anonymity and lack of accountability that are often associated with online communication set up a supportive environment for the spread of far-right ideologies and the radicalization of individuals into extremist groups.
Far-right extremism is a form of ideology that advocates for ultranationalism, racism, and opposition to immigration and multiculturalism. These ideologies are strongly correlated with violence and terrorism, and pose a threat to individual and collective security.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) has made comments raising concerns about the young age of Australians being radicalized, the use of online technologies and the rise of extremist movements in Australia [@asio]. They have further suggested that during the COVID period, up to 30-40% of their caseload was devoted to far-right extremism, up from 10-15% in 2016 [@guardian1]. 

Unfortunately, ideologically motivated violent extremism continues to be an issue in Australia. On December 12th, 2022, two Queensland police officers were killed while performing routine duties [@guardian2]. Later investigations would uncover that the three people, who killed the officers, were active online in producing deep-state and religious conspiratorial content. The content has since been taken down from mainstream social platforms but continues to be shared on conspiratorial websites.
Online content often serves as a lead indicator of violent extremism (as was the case in this incident and the Christchurch Mosque Shootings three years prior). However, the tools to identify and understand the psychosocial characteristics of these extreme individuals and communities are lacking.

In this work, we build an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline and build psychosocial profiles of ideological groups. We find that right-wing individuals tend to use moral-vice language quantifiably more the left-wing individuals, and that far-right individuals’ use of grievance language (violence, hate, paranoia, etc.) is significantly different from moderates.

## Signals of Ideology

In online social settings, researchers face numerous barriers that prevent traditional methods; directly asking users’ for their ideologies has dubious success, infringes on platform T&Cs, and does not scale to online populations. The alternative of manual expert inference of users’ ideologies through their activity, also does not scale.

Instead, in an effort to reduce expert labor to feasible levels, researchers infer ideologies from signals in user behavior. We dub these signals –_ideological proxies_—, and they include using political hashtags, retweeting politicians, or following political parties.

Importantly, these _ideological proxies_ for online users can still require laborious labeling by context-specific experts! For example, the hashtag _#ScottyFromMarketing_ requires an up-to-date expert in Australian politics to uncover that it expresses an anti-right-wing ideology. For many researchers:
- access to contextual experts is difficult,
- labeling of signals is still laborious and expensive,
- and, switches in contexts require relabelling (exasperating the above problems).

Unfortunately, such context-switches are common for practitioners, and each new dataset can have contextual changes in time, country, social platform, etc. 
This problem is exemplified in Figure \@ref(fig:teaser) below wherein each of the contexts, the _ideological proxy_ can only be transferred in narrow circumstances (represented by the green dotted regions).
As such, we desire an _ideological proxy_ that is robust to changes in context, requires no expert labeling and is valid with respect to a gold standard.

```{r teaser, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Schema showing that not all ideological proxies can context-switch.', out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics('teaser_v2.svg')
```
<!-- ![Not all ideological proxies can context-switch](teaser.png) -->

Furthermore, the _ideological proxies_ are often sparse among users; however, we would ideally like to detect influence amongst the entire population of users (as taking only active users could bias our inferences).
We further desire a method for inferring the ideology of (potentially inactive) users, who don’t have any direct _ideological proxy_ information.

## Our Solution: You are what you browse

Our solution is a large-scale end-to-end ideology detection pipeline, that can be used to profile entire populations of users. The solution has two main components; the media proxy and the inference architecture. The media proxy allows for labeling a subset of users, and the inference architecture allows for propagating these labels to the remaining users via socially-informed homophilic lenses. 

### The Media Proxy
For the first part of our work, we generate a proxy based on media-sharing behavior which satisfies the desiderata. 

Briefly, the media proxy is generated via two datasets of media slant (although many media slant datasets are widely available). The first is a large survey of media consumption behaviors conducted by Reuters [@newman2019reuters], in a variety of countries in 2020 and 2021, where participants report the media publications they consume and their own political ideology. We define the slant of a media source for each country and year, as the average ideology of the participants who consume it. The second dataset is the Allsides Media Bias Dataset [@sides2018media] which contains an expert-curated set of media publications. The Allsides dataset contains mostly American-based media; conversely,  Reuters lists the major media for a range of countries. Given that each country and time period will have a different conception of ideologies, we calibrate Reuter’s media slants to approximate the Allsides (minimizing the mean-squared error). Figure \@ref(fig:slants) shows the slants for each media website within the Reuters dataset.

```{r slants, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Plot showing the slants for various media websites.', out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics('url_slants.svg')
```
<!-- ![The slants for various media websites](./url_slants.png) -->

We finally define the media slant of a media website, as its average over the country, year, and sources, and we define the ideology of a user as the average ideology of the media they share.

The schema above exemplifies how the media proxy resolves the issue of context switching; namely, since the media proxy is applicable across many contexts, it can be used widely in a fully automatic fashion. This allows us to create an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline.

We further define methods to classify far-right users from their media-sharing behaviors, which we don't address here but are described fully in the paper.

### The Inference Architecture
For the second part of our work, we define an inference architecture that allows us to infer the ideological labels of the remaining users. Our inference architecture relies on the sociological principle of homophily, where we hypothesize that similar users will share a similar ideology. We measure homophily through three distinct lenses; 

  1. *Lexical*: Users with similar language will have similar ideology
  2. *Hashtag*: Users who participate in similar topics of discussion with share similar ideology
  3. *Resharing*: Users who consume similar content (signaled via resharing of other users) will share a similar ideology

Through these lenses, we utilize an AutoML model, FLAML [@wang2021flaml] (with the LightGBM architecture), trained on users identified via an ideological proxy, to propagate the labels to the remaining users and generate a full ideological profile for a dataset.

## The Data
We utilize several large-scale datasets from a variety of platforms, to showcase the relative ease of applying our end-to-end pipeline. The datasets’ characteristics are described in Table \@ref(tab:datasets). 
<!-- For evaluation purposes, we use \#QandA based on the popular ABC panel show. -->

```{r datasets, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The datasets used through-out the analysis.', out.width = "700px"}
library(data.table)
tab <- data.table(cbind(
  Dataset=c('#Qanda', '#Ausvotes', '#SocialSense', 'Riot', 'Parler'),
  Users=c('103,074', '273,874', '49,442', '574,281', '120,048'),
  Posts=c('768,808', '5,033,982', '358,292', '1,067,794', '603,820'),
  Country=c('AUS','AUS','AUS','US','US'))
           )
  knitr::kable(
    tab, booktabs = TRUE,
    caption = 'The datasets used through-out the analysis, with the number of users, posts, and affliated country.'
  )
```

### Psychosocial profiles of the Ideological Groups
Large-scale profiling of entire online populations gives us significant insights into the characteristics of online populations. We apply our inferred ideological labels of online users, in two critical ways:

1. We derive a method for distinguishing the left and the right in terms of their moral language.
2. We derive a method for distinguishing moderate and extreme ideologies in terms of their grievance language.

**Distinguishing Left and Right**: 
We utilize the FrameAxis [@mokhberian2020moral] methodology to metricize each user’s association with each of the five Moral Foundations [@graham2013moral] in terms of their vice and virtue axes. 
Given the measures of the Moral Foundations in the user language, we can start to detect in what way the left and the right differ. To do this we find the mean vice and virtue scores for each ideological group and compare these to the neutral group. Figure \@ref(fig:mft) shows the outcome of this analysis on the SocialSense dataset.

```{r mft, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Plot of the moral foundations of ideological groups in the SocialSense dataset, showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language.', out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics('mft_diff_plot.svg')
```
<!-- ![Plot showing that the left prefer virtue and the right prefer vice language](mft_diff_plot.png) -->

We see that the left prefers the language of virtue, while the right prefers the language of vice. This trend is largely consistent across all datasets.

**Distinguishing Moderates and Extremes**: We similarly generate measures via the Grievance Dictionary [@van2021grievance], which is a threat assessment tool designed to highlight potential threats through their language. Similar to the previous plot, we investigate the distribution of grievance scores for the ideological groups, but here we measure the difference between distributions with the Signed KL-divergence (a measure of the difference in the location and shape of distributions). Figure \@ref(fig:grievance) shows the results for the Ausvotes dataset.

```{r grievance, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Plot of the grievance categories of ideological groups in the #Ausvotes dataset, showing that the far-right is significantly different.', out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics('grievance_diff_plot.svg')
```
<!-- ![Plot showing that the far-right use grievance language](grievance_diff_plot.png) -->

We observe that the far-right’s usage of grievance language is significantly different from the moderate ideological groups. This adds evidence to the growing concern that members of the far-right may participate in violent behavior. 

## Conclusion
In this work, we build a fully automatic end-to-end ideology detection pipeline for left-right and far-right detection. 
Importantly, with the pipeline, we can show the differences between the left and right, and moderates and extremes in terms of psychosocial language, across a range of diverse datasets.
