Why?: I could not find an easy way to shift everyone down one week due to a public holiday.
How solved?: I created an Excel file with the same content: `Reading group schedule.xlsx`

Process:
1. Edit the Excel file accordingly 
2. Export in CSV using TABULATOR as separator (not comma!)
3. Paste the content of the CSV in https://donatstudios.com/CsvToMarkdownTable
4. Take the MD and replace the content in `reading.md`
5. (optional) remove extra white spaces by searching for "  " (two spaces) and replacing with " " (one space). Careful at line 11, where 4 spaces are required.
